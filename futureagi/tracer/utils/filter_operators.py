"""Shared filter operator helpers.

Some older clients used display-oriented operator names such as ``equal_to``.
Backend filter builders should use the canonical API contract names below. The
aliases remain only for non-span legacy filter surfaces; canonical-only paths
must validate the raw operator directly.
